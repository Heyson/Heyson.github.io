Hi there, Im Heyson. I like to make eye catching visuals and making them pop off the screen with a little dose of interactivity. Im a designer at heart with ambitions of becoming a developer with skills equal to my artistic talent.

I love to learn new skills and incorporating them in everything I do. My personality fits that of a nutty proffesor and some times stumble on to great projects ideas on accident.

Please feel free to browse through my portfolio site, and if your interested in what you see, and what I can accomplish for you, by all means contact me and we can talk.
